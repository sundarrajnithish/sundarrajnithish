# 👋 Hi there, I'm Nitish Sundarraj

🎓 Master's candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Concordia University, with a strong foundation in mechatronics, robotics, and automation.

🔧 I build smart systems—from autonomous robots and gesture-controlled manipulators to full-stack cloud platforms. My passion lies in integrating hardware and software seamlessly to solve real-world problems.

💡 Key skills:
- Embedded Systems & Automation: Real-time control, sensor integration, PLC programming (Codesys, CIROS)
- Software Development: Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Flask, React, Git
- AI & Vision: Deep learning (TensorFlow), OpenCV, 2D/3D object detection
- Industrial Tools: LabVIEW (basic), Autodesk, SQL/NoSQL databases
- Cloud & Web: SaaS system design, RESTful APIs, Vite, CI/CD workflows

🚀 Projects:
- **AuctionHub** – SaaS auction platform using cloud APIs and NoSQL
- **FARM-E** – Autonomous agriculture robot with smart control sequences
- **Hydroponics Automation** – Smart plant growth system with environmental regulation
- **Gesture-Based Manipulator** – Embedded + AI project with Firebase, OpenCV
